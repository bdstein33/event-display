# Question 2

Lyft is a product I use frequently and with pleasure.  I believe Lyft was designed with a strong awareness of what users use it for. Here are a few specific reasons I love Lyftâ€™s design:

1. Top to botton flow

The steps a user must take to request a car flow from top to bottom.  At the top of the screen, users select what type of car they want, then they select their pickup and drop off locations, then, at the bottom, they request the car.  This is very intuitive, especially compared to Uber which requires users to select their address at the top of the screen, then select their car type at the bottom, then request the car in the middle.

2. Saved home and work address address 

Lyft knows the two places its typical user travels to most are home and work.  Users can save these addresses for easy access from the destination screen or straight from the map.  This makes it way faster to request a car when traveling to one of these locations.

3. Relevant Information

Lyft shows users the relevant information they want on the home view without cluttering the screen like Uber does.  At any point users can see their to and from addresses, what credit card will be billed, and their ride cost (for Lyft Line).  Because all of this information is visible on the home page, I rarely ever go to other views of the app.
