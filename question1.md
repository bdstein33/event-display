# Question 1

I recently read a blog post that provides an overview of some of the new features in ECMAScript 6 (https://blog.logentries.com/2014/12/es6-javascript-in-harmony-an-overview-of-new-language-features/).  JavaScript is the language I am most comfortable with and I love learning about new tools and features that enable me to write better code.  A few features I'm most excited to use are:

- Back-tick Strings: This new type of string ignores line breaks and enables embedded expression values so that variables can be inserted into strings with less effort.
- Promises:  Although there are many libraries that already provide this functionality, it will be better to have a language standard that doesn't need to be imported in.
- New Variable Declarations: ES6 provides some alternatives to variable declaration in addition to var.  let, for example, enables you to to declare variables to the scope of the current code block (loops, if statements, etc.), which will help eliminate some edge cases where var declarations get hoisted in unintended ways.

This article is worth reading because ES6 will soon be widely used and understanding its new features will enable you to write better JavaScript.
